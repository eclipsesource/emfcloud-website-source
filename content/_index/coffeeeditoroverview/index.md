The <em>Coffee Editor NG</em> is a comprehensive example modeling tool based on EMF Cloud technologies and can also act as an architecture blueprint for your custom modeling tool.
This full-featured example tool is written entirely in Typescript and includes a central model hub serving a sample modeling language to a variety of editors, such as a diagram editor, a form-based editor, as well as a textual DSL editor.
