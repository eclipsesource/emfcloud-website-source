EMF Cloud is a set of open-source technologies for building next-generation modeling tools based on a modern web technology stack.
</p>
<p>
Whether you develop a custom IDE that includes multiple graphical editors manipulating complex configuration data, or a UML-like modeling tool, or a domain-specific engineering tool with graphical or form-based editors for working with domain-specific models, EMF Cloud provides several components to make your life easier.
The EMF Cloud components range from an extensible model hub providing an API to access and manipulate your model, an editing domain to manage the model state and coordinate changes in a command stack, as well as libraries for integrating form-based, graphical or textual editors.

<!-- <p>
The EMF Cloud technologies include an extensible model management framework that centralizes the de/serialization, validation and processing of your custom models and coordinates changes across your domain-specific editors manipulating those models.>
