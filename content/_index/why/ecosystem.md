EMF Cloud is a flexible architecture of compatible libraries and components embedded in a rich ecosystem of well-established best-in-class open-source technologies inside and outside of the EMF Cloud project. To name a few of them, EMF Cloud is close friends and works well with [Eclipse GLSP]({{< ref "documentation/diagrameditor" >}}), [JSON Forms]({{< ref "documentation/treeeditor" >}}), [Langium]({{< ref "documentation/langium" >}}), as well as [EMF and Xtext]({{< ref "documentation/emf" >}}).
