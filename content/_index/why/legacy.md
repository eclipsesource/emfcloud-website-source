Not every modeling tool is developed from scratch. EMF Cloud therefore offers optional Java components to enable [integrating EMF models]({{< ref "/documentation/emf" >}}) on the backend into a modern modeling tool with a web-based frontend. These Java components are carefully designed so that the EMF dependency is encapsulated to facilitate a smooth migration path in the future.
