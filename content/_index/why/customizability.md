EMF Cloud is not a monolith, but a [set of libraries designed to be customized]({{< ref "documentation/overview" >}}). To accommodate different data formats, user interfaces, or even deployment scenarios, such as cloud backends vs. frontend-only browser apps, you can combine and adapt existing EMF Cloud components or replace certain parts with your custom code for your use case.
