Modeling features built with EMF Cloud can be integrated with VS Code, Eclipse Theia, or any arbitrary web application. The model management can even operate as a backend service in the cloud, or bundled with webpack to run in a frontend-only browser app, making any need for a backend obsolete while still providing a full-fledged modeling tool.
