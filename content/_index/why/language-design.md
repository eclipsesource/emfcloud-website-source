EMF Cloud takes a very simple and pragmatic approach for [defining the structure of your model data]({{< ref "documentation/modelingLanguage" >}}). For the usual cases, you just define Typescript interfaces and annotate them with meta-information, if necessary, and the rest is taken care of by the EMF Cloud tooling to create a model hub that is capable of managing data according to your model structure.
