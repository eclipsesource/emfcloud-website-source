EMF Cloud makes your data models available to all your editors, views and services with an [extensible *model hub*]({{< ref "documentation/modelhub" >}}) via an extensible API. By default those models are stored in JSON files, but also custom file formats, textual DSLs, or even arbitrary other data sources can be integrated.
