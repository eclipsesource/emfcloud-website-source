EMF Cloud is a set of open-source technologies for building next-generation modeling tools based on a modern web technology stack.
In combination with other components and platforms of the open-source ecosystem, EMF Cloud simplifies developing all kinds of modeling tools, whether they are custom modeling suites for domain-specific languages with Eclipse Theia, adaptable general purpose UML-like modeling extensions for VS Code, or tailored configurators for custom data formats in plain web applications.
You can also use EMF Cloud technologies to enrich your custom IDE with certain modeling tool features, such as integrated form-based editors, graphical diagram editors, and textual DSLs.

Most of the EMF Cloud components are frameworks written in Typescript either running in the browser or on a node-based backend.
They range from model management components to provide consistent access to underlying models from mulitple types of editors within a tool to integration code with third-party technologies and platforms, such as [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org), VS Code, [Langium](https://langium.org), [Eclipse GLSP](https://eclipse.dev/glsp/), or [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io).
If you need to reuse EMF-based tools and thus require Java on the backend, EMF Cloud also provides dedicated components to allow accessing and manipulating EMF models a modern web-based tool environment.
